aye bruh, ignore the controllers and DrawerNav file for now.

also keep in mind that package.json has all of the external libraries listed, but the libraries themselves (node_modules) are not included in the codebase. 
this is cuz them things is heavy af, and its more efficient to push a json file of all the libraries rather then the libraries themselves.

so, do this one step b4 changing or testing anything. in the terminal, type "npm install". This will read the package.json file and automatically install everything.

let get it.
